.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
The simplest way to use genlop is
.br 
genlop category/ebuild
.LP 
To view last 10 merges, run
.br 
genlop \-l | tail \-n 10
.LP 
To view how long merging openoffice took
.br 
genlop \-t openoffice
.LP 
To estimate how much 'emerge \-u world' will take
.br 
emerge \-pu world | genlop \-\-pretend
.LP 
Have a console watching the latest merging ebuild during upgrade
.br 
watch genlop \-\-current \-\-nocolor
.LP 
For use in terminals that do not support ANSI
.br 
genlop \-un x11\-libs/qt
.LP 
If you rotate emerge.log you could use:
.br 
genlop \-tu \-f /var/log/emerge.log \-f /var/log/emerge.log.0 \-f /var/log/emerge.log.1.gz ...  <category/ebuild>
.LP 
Full merge history
.br 
genlop \-lu
.LP 
Search ebuilds that match a regular expression
.br 
genlop \-s gen[lt]o
.LP 
what was it that I installed last week ?
.br 
genlop -l --date last week
.LP 
and the week before that ?
.br 
genlop -l --date 2 weeks ago --date last week
.LP
You have installed an ftp server on monday and you want to know what USE was
specified. If you don't remember the exact ebuild name, use -s and perform
a regexp search
.br
genlop -si ftp --date last monday --date last monday
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
Perl module Date::Manip is required for genlop to work.
.br
Perl module Time::Duration is no longer required since genlop 0.30
.SH "BUGS"
.RB "- The " "--current" " option only works if FEATURES contains 'sandbox' and does not contain 'userpriv', or if FEATURES contains 'sandbox' and 'userpriv' and 'usersandbox'. You can check this by running `portageq envvar FEATURES\' and checking its output."
.TP
 - definitley too many options !
