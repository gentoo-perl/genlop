genlop 0.30.5 17/08/2005
	Emergency Bugfixing
	. mispelled chomp as chop, ugly! <hits self on head with big hammer>
	. Jeroen Roovers <rooversj@xs4all.nl> submitted patches for correct handling
	  of dashes in --current and --pretend, for correct handling of whitespace
	  during sandbox detection AND for bypassing portageq slowness, thanks !
	
genlop 0.30.4 29/07/2005
	More Bugfixes:
	. now uses ps to find pids of sandbox processes for the -c option 
	  instead of hardcoded /tmp/sandbox.pids which no longer exists in the
	  latest emerge versions (thanks CJ van den Berg <cj@vdbonline.com>)
	  We'll see how long this solution lasts...
	  closes gentoo bugzilla #99823
	. fixed a problem where the -c option would uncorrectly print "any time
	  now" (thanks David Morton <bob@littletimmy.homelinux.com>)
	  closes gentoo bugzilla #97049
	. genlop.bash.completion now gets PORTAGEDIR from make.conf instead of
